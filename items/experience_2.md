## Going to Worlds Championship in VEX Robotics

When: Mar 2022 - May 2022

What: I got the opportunity to go to a World Championship in Texas to compete in robotics. I loved robotics as a kid and in my very first year I got to compete in Texas. I was the driver for the team which means the results of the team where in my hands where I had to compete against others driving a robot collecting rings and landing on a seesaw.

Favourite Memory: This has to be at provincials when they called our names for an award that qualifies us to the World Championship. Nobody believed that our robot could make it that far and all my teammates except one left and me and one other were left to see if we qualified and we did.

What I didn't enjoy: The amount of hours I would put in to practice. I was there most days from 1pm to 6pm just constantly practicing over and over again to make sure I was gonna lead my team to victory

Grade: A
