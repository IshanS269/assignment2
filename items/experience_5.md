## Becoming the AV person at my Temple.

When: July 2022

What: I usually was with my grandpa spending time and running the AV system there for thousands of people in person and on live stream. One day he got covid so I ended up having to run it by myself which was scary but really fun because I got a lot of praise for it.

Favourite Memory: It has to be when everyone came up to me at the end telling me how good of a job I did because it was my first time in front of thousands of people and I did well.

What I didn't enjoy: when the people trying to tell me to do my job when I was doing it. A lot of people their feel entitled and love saying the first thing that comes to their head. They try to tell me to turn this up or lower the volume when I know what I am doing and it sounds good.
