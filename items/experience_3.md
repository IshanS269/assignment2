## Working at Zebra Robotics

When: May 2022 - August 2024

What: After being a student, the owner gave me an opportunity to coach kids and teach them what I have learned after 7 years of being a student

Favourite Memory: In my summer camp of 2023, I learned how to create battle bots for the kids and they loved it and I shared it with the rest of the coaches and it became a hit!

What I didn't like: The hours their sucked and I wish I worked more.

Grade: C
