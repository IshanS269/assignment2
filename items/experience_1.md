## Coding for Apple Swift

When: Feb 2022 - June 2022

What Was Good About It: I learned a brand new coding language that can help me develop apps which will help me in university and I created a connection with the owner of SWIFT and I can reach out to him whenever I need to for advice or a possible job opportunity. 

Favorite Memory: Hopping on zoom calls showing him my work and hearing him praise me made it worth it.

What I Didnâ€™t Enjoy: The amount of hours I have worked to prepare for a presentation in this class was around 3-4 hours a day for months.
